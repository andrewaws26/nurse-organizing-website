    <title>Nurse Unionizing in Louisville: An Interactive Report</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/3.7.1/chart.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: 
        Structure: A single-page, vertically scrolling thematic design. A persistent top navigation bar (Home, Timeline, Tactics, Analysis, Recommendations) allows users to jump to sections, facilitating non-linear exploration.
        Sections:
        1. Home/Overview: A hero section with the title, a summary of the key finding (no successful unions due to intense, often illegal, opposition), and a "Key Takeaways" card deck.
        2. Timeline: An interactive HTML/CSS timeline. Clicking a point on the timeline dynamically updates a "details" card, making the history digestible.
        3. Tactics: A two-column "Playbook" comparing organizer and management tactics. Clicking any card opens a modal (div overlay) with a detailed description.
        4. Analysis: An interactive "dashboard" featuring a Chart.js horizontal bar chart visualizing the "Key Barriers." Clicking a bar on the chart updates a central text block to explain that factor in detail.
        5. Recommendations: An accordion component built with HTML/JS, allowing users to expand each recommendation.
        User Flow: User lands on a clear summary. They can scroll linearly or use the nav to jump to a specific interest (e.g., "Why did it fail?"). The interactive elements (timeline, tactic modals, analysis chart, accordion) encourage active exploration.
        Justification: This structure transforms a dense, text-based report into an exploratory experience. It isolates key concepts (Timeline, Tactics, Analysis) into interactive modules, which is much more user-friendly and aids comprehension, especially for the "Tactics" and "Analysis" sections where direct comparison and interaction are valuable.
    -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Historical Events (1989-2000s) -> Goal: Show chronology -> Viz/Presentation: HTML/CSS Timeline -> Interaction: Click event to update a separate details box. -> Justification: More engaging and less overwhelming than a long text block. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Organizer & Management Tactics -> Goal: Compare opposing strategies -> Viz/Presentation: Two-column card layout with modals -> Interaction: Click card to open a modal (div overlay) with details. -> Justification: Directly contrasts the "playbook" for each side and hides detailed text until requested. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Analysis of Failure -> Goal: Visualize the relative impact of key factors -> Viz/Presentation: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Click on a bar (e.g., "Legal Delays") to update a text area with the full explanation. Tooltips on hover. -> Justification: Provides a strong visual anchor for the analysis. The interactivity directly links the visual data to the qualitative text. Method: Chart.js/Canvas + JS click handler.
        - Report Info: Recommendations -> Goal: Present actionable advice clearly -> Viz/Presentation: Accordion component -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse each recommendation. -> Justification: Clean, scannable, and allows users to focus on one recommendation at a time. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.

                An interactive report on the history of nurse unionizing efforts in Louisville, Kentucky, detailing the persistent attempts by nurses and the formidable opposition they face.

                This application explores the decades-long fight for a nurse's union in Louisville. Despite numerous organizing drives, most notably by the Nurses Professional Organization (NPO) and National Nurses United (NNU), no major hospital system in the city currently has a registered nurse union. This report analyzes the tactics used by both organizers and management, the factors contributing to these failures, and potential strategies for the future.
